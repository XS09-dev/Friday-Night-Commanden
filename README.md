# Friday-Night-Commands
Gives you a folder with all the CMD folders to install Friday Night Funkin' With.

YOU MUST:
install Haxe 4.1.5 or 4.2.4. Here is the link. https://haxe.org/download/version/4.2.4/
Than install Git. https://git-scm.com/downloads
Finally Install https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes after downloading make sure to download these indiviual components.
```
MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools
Windows SDK (10.0.17763.0) 
```
After that you have to open these .cmd files in the order given.
```
- HaxeFlixel.cmd
- flixet_shit.cmd
- git_shit.cmd
```
After doing that you can compile the normal source and psych. I will eventually add a file for kade titled kade.cmd. Which installs all the kade shit.
